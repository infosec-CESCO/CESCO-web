## Notes

The program counter (PC) is a byte offset in the deployed [code](/about). It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an [ADD](/#01) is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The [PUSH](/#60) instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

The **JUMP** instruction alters the program counter, thus breaking the linear path of the execution to another point in the deployed [code](/about). It is used to implement functionalities like functions.

## Stack input

0. `counter`: byte offset in the deployed [code](/about) where execution will continue from. Must be a [JUMPDEST](/#5B) instruction.

## Example

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- `Counter` offset is not a [JUMPDEST](/#5B). The error is generated even if the JUMP would not have been done.
