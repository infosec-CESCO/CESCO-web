## Notes

The [memory](/about) is always fully accessible. What this instruction tracks is the highest offset that was accessed in the current execution. A first write or read to a bigger offset will trigger a [memory expansion](/about), which will cost gas. The size is always a multiple of a word (32 bytes).

## Stack output

0. `size`: current [memory](/about) size in bytes (higher offset accessed until now + 1).

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
